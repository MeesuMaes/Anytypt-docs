# Raycast Extension (macOS)

Our long-awaited API is beginning to take shape! The first step is Raycast integration, allowing you to create, read, and delete Spaces, Objects, and Types, as well as search across them, all from Raycast on macOS.

While this initial version focuses on a basic set of features, we’re laying the groundwork for an open API that will eventually support bulk import and export, NoCode tools, and more integrations. We’re excited to see what you’ll build!
