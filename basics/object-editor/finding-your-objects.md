# Locating Your Objects

### Use the Graph

To find all of your objects and how they are connected, you can look to the Graph for your main source of truth.

Read more about the [graph.md](../graph.md "mention") here.

### Browse through EVERYTHING

Additionally, to see all of the objects you've created in your space, you can use the [anytype-library](../anytype-library/ "mention") system widget that can be found at the top of your sidebar (just below your space name).

### Use the Search

As a last resort, if you still can't find what you're looking for, try and search for it.

To navigate to the search, head to your sidebar, and click on the magnifier icon.

### Bin

If you've previously removed some objects from your [space](../space/ "mention"), they will appear in your [finding-your-objects.md](../anytype-library/finding-your-objects.md "mention") unless you've already permanently deleted them.
