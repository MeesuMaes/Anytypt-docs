To see all of the objects you've created in your space, you can use the [.](./ "mention") widget that can be found at the top of your sidebar (just below your space name).

## Managing your Objects

There are currently seven tabs in the All Objects widget:

2. Lists - [sets.md](../sets-and-collections/sets.md "mention") and [collections.md](../sets-and-collections/collections.md "mention")
3. Media - Images and Videos
4. Bookmarks
5. Files - All other Files&#x20;
6. [types](../types/ "mention")
7. [relations](../relations/ "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
